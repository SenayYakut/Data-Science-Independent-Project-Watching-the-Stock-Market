## Project Tasks
Get started - hosting your project
DB Browser for SQLite 1.2k is a visual tool for working with SQLite databases. Follow the link to download the application for your computer.



SQLite can store an entire database in a single file, which usually has a .sqlite or .db extension. To open a database, select Open Database at the top of the window and browse for the file. Alternatively, you can choose to create a New Database by saving a file with the .sqlite or .db extension.
To import data from a CSV file into a table, select “File > Import > Table from CSV file…” and browse for the CSV file. (Note: All fields imported from the CSV file will have a data type of TEXT. Be sure to convert fields to numeric type as needed. See here 163 for how to do that.)


There are several tabs near the top of the window for working with the data:

* Database Structure: View the tables in your database and the columns they contain.
* Browse Data: Browse the data for each table.
* Execute SQL: Write and execute SQL queries.
